This repository is a fork of [DistroTube's Configuring Emacs](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/configuring-emacs) project. Step by step guide to build from vanila emacs can be found in [Configuring Emacs video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1fgypEiQkE&list=PL5--8gKSku15e8lXf7aLICFmAHQVo0KXX&index=1).

### Things To Note:
This is a configuration for Windows. It does not include some of the featurese presented on the series due to compatibility and my preferences.

### When Setting your own Windows emacs configuration:
- Add $HOME environment variable path to â€œC:\Users\username" *(Recommended*)
	- Otherwise, you would find your emacs home directory set to "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming" 
- Always run emacs with emacsclient
	- Have your emacs daemon running
